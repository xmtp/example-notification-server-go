This project is ready to serve as a reference for you to start building.

Many applications will have different needs for push notifications (different delivery providers, different metadata attached to payloads, etc), and this repo is designed to be forked and customized for each application's needs.

## Prerequisites

1. Go 1.20
2. Docker and Docker Compose

## Local Setup

To start the XMTP service and database, run:

```sh
./dev/up
```

You should then be able to build the server using:

```sh
./dev/build
```

## Usage

### Running the server

The server can be run using the `./dev/run` script. Both the `worker` (which listens for new messages on the XMTP network and sends push notifications) and the `api` service (which handles HTTP/GRPC requests) are optional, but are recommended to be both enabled in local development. In a deployed environment it may be more desirable to split these services up so that you can have N instances of `api` and a single `worker`.

```sh
## Only has to be run once
./dev/up
./dev/start
```

### Command line options

To see a full list of command line options run

```sh
./dev/run --help
```

Here is the output as of 03/01/2024:

      --http-auth-header=

Help Options:
  -h, --help                               Show this help message
```

### Generating code

If you have made a change to the files in the `proto` folder, you will need to regenerate the related Go code. You can do that with:

```sh
./dev/gen-proto
```

You must have the `Buf` CLI installed on your machine. Learn more [here](https://buf.build/docs/installation).

### Testing the API

The API supports plain JSON and can be used via CURL

```sh
./dev/run --api
curl \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"installationId": "123", "deliveryMechanism": {"apnsDeviceToken": "foo"}}' \
    http://localhost:8080/notifications.v1.Notifications/RegisterInstallation
```

### Running the tests

Test files must be run serially right now, due to the shared database instance which is wiped after most tests.

```sh
go test -p 1 ./...
```

## Extending the server

The implementation of the `Delivery` service are designed to be easily extended. For a production application, you will likely want to replace them with a more robust set of tools for sending notifications idempotently. To do that, you would modify `cmd/server/main.go` and add a Delivery Service implementation.

If you are using Firebase for push delivery, the only modifications needed (if any) may be to customize the payload sent to clients.

## Deployment

You will need to deploy your own instance of the Notification Server, with the appropriate credentials to send push notifications on behalf of your app. The deployed service will require access to a Postgres database as well as the ability to connect to the public internet.

You may choose to run both the API and Listener in a single service or as two separate services, depending on the expected load to the API server. For high traffic applications it is recommended to run the API server and Listener as separate services.

## Implementing a client

Once you have the server deployed, you will need to connect to it from your client application to register devices and subscriptions. There is a guide to help guide you in this process [here](./docs/notifications-client-guide.md).
